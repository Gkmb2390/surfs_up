# surfs_up

# Purpose
    The excercies this week was designed for us to be able to easily access and retrieve data from an SQLite database.  Convert that data from the flat file into a DataFrame. Then filter the dataframe to show the aggregate of all June and Decemeber data.

# Review of Analysis
1. After completing the analysis of the June and December data, it is quite clear that that our surf shop should prove successful.  While the count of data points is off by roughly 200, favoring June's data, we see that a majority of the statistical data is remarkably similar.  For example, the Max temperature difference between June and December is only 2 degrees.

    )
2. Similarly when we review the 2 charts above we see that the standard deviation for each month is roughly similar, being off by only .53 difference.  This should indicate that statistically the data sets are nearly the same.  Ultimately December data falls within 1-2 Standard deviations of the June data - meaning the weather in December while less likely to resemeble June; would still feel fairly similarly.   
    
3.  The Average temperatures measured during both time periods fall within 4 degrees of one another. So again we shouldn't be surprised to see business remain steady when comparing expecations based on outdoor temperatures - assuming all other things are equal.   


# Additional Analyses 

1.  It would make sense to dive deeper, no pun intended, into temperature data on 2 fronts: 1 on a quarterly front to more accurately define what should be expected over longer periods of time.  Understanding the overall quarterly pattern of the weather will allow for more clear business decisions, specifically when decideing whether or not to be operating during a particular time period.    

2.  Additionally, a through analysis of the water temperatures during the times specified above would be incredibly helpful.  We would obviously expect to see a direct correlation between the registered temperatures, and the water temperatures - however, we may find that the water temperatures are too cold for the tourists to be interested in surfing or shakes.
